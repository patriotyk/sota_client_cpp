sota_client_cpp
------

This project houses the C++ reference implementation of a client for the [GENIVI SOTA](https://github.com/advancedtelematic/rvi_sota_server) project. The client is intended to be installed on devices that wish to recive OTA updates from a GENIVI-compatible OTA server.

The client is responsible for:

 - Communicating with the OTA server
 - Authenticating using locally available device and user credentials
 - Reporting current software and hardware configuration to the server
 - Checking for any available updates for the device
 - Downloaded any available updates
 - Installing the updates on the system, or notifying other services of the availability of the downloaded file
 - Receiving or generating installation reports (success or failure) for attempts to install received software
 - Submitting installation reports to the server

The client maintains the integrity and confidentiality of the OTA update in transit, communicating with the server over a TLS link. The client can run either as a system service, periodically checking for updates, or can by triggered by other system interactions (for example on user request, or on receipt of a wake-up message from the OTA server).

Usage
------
Run the client and provide a yaml formatted configuration file using the commandline option -c or --config. The configuration file has to contain the OAuth2 server URL, the SOTA server URL, a valid clientID and according secret and a valid device UUID. See the example config file at config/config.yml.example. The client will use the clientID and according secret to get an OAuth2 token from the authorization server which is then used to send API requests to the SOTA server.

~~~
sota_client -c <path/configfile>
~~~

Dependencies
------
The following debian packages are used in the project:

 - libboost-dev
 - libboost-program-options-dev (>= 1.58.0)
 - libboost-system-dev (>= 1.58.0)
 - libboost-thread-dev (>= 1.58.0)
 - libboost-log-dev (>= 1.58.0)
 - libboost-regex-dev (>= 1.58.0)
 - libboost-test-dev (>= 1.58.0)
 - libpthread-stubs0-dev (>=0.3)
 - libyaml-cpp-dev (>=0.5.2)
 - curl (>= 7.47)
 - libcurl4-openssl-dev (>= 7.47)
 - cmake (>= 3.5.1)

Building
------

The `sota_client` is built using CMake. To setup your `build` directory:

~~~
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
~~~

You can then build the project from the `build` directory using Make:

~~~
make
~~~

Linting
-----

Before checking in code, the code linting checks should be run:

~~~
make qa
~~~

Testing
-----

To run the test suite:

~~~
make test
~~~

Code Coverage
-----

The project can be configured to generate a code coverage report. First, create a CMake build directory for coverage builds, and invoke CMake with the `-DBUILD_WITH_CODE_COVERAGE=ON` flag:

~~~
mkdir build-coverage
cd build-coverage
cmake -DBUILD_WITH_CODE_COVERAGE=ON ..
~~~

Then use Make from the `build-coverage` directory to run the coverage report:

~~~
make coverage
~~~

The report will be output to the `coverage` folder in your `build-coverage` directory.

Building / Testing with Docker
-----

A Dockerfile is provided to support building / testing the application without dependencies on your local environment. If you have a working docker client and docker server running on your machine, you can build a docker image with:

~~~
docker build -t advancedtelematic/sota_client_cpp .
~~~

and run

~~~
docker run --rm -it advancedtelematic/sota_client_cpp make
~~~

to build the software,

~~~
docker run --rm -it advancedtelematic/sota_client_cpp make test
~~~

to run the tests, and

~~~
docker run --rm -it advancedtelematic/sota_client_cpp build/target/sota_client
~~~

to run the client. If you want the build artifacts to appear on your host machine (outside of the docker container), you can try

~~~
mkdir build
docker run --rm -it --read-only -u $UID -v $PWD/build:/source/build advancedtelematic/sota_client_cpp make
~~~

though be aware that the output binary (`build/target/sota_client`) may have dynamic linking requirements that are not met by your host environment. Also note that running the linting rule (`make qa`) may attempt to modify the source files in the Docker container. If the linting rule is run with `-u $UID` or `--read-only`, the execution will fail with an `llvm` segfault when the linter outputs the source files.
